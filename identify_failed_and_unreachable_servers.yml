the question is --
let us say i have 10 group of servers and i have executed the playbook, so this playbook is completely run, but the issue is -- the task from that playbook is ran on some system but failed also on some system, 
so how can i get the information of those failed nodes??

From the playbook output (default way)
At the end of every playbook run, Ansible prints a PLAY RECAP.
Example:
PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
server1 : ok=10  changed=5  unreachable=0  failed=0
server2 : ok=7   changed=3  unreachable=0  failed=1
server3 : ok=10  changed=5  unreachable=0  failed=0
server4 : ok=6   changed=2  unreachable=1  failed=0
How to identify failed nodes
Look at:
failed > 0
unreachable > 0
From above:
❌ server2 → task failed
❌ server4 → unreachable
👉 This is the first and simplest place to check.


Using --limit to rerun only failed nodes
Ansible automatically creates a special group called failed (and unreachable) during execution.
Rerun playbook only on failed hosts:
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit failed


For unreachable hosts:
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit unreachable
👉 Very useful in real production when you don’t want to rerun on all 10 groups again.


Using --list-hosts with limit
To just see which hosts failed, without running anything:
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit failed --list-hosts
hosts (2):
  server2
  server5
