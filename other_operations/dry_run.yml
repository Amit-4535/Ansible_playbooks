Dry run means we will check the playbook is formatted correctly or not, before its actual execution

Command to check is ïƒ  ansible-playbook playbookname.yml - -check

this command will execute and it will provide you the details that whether this playbook is formatted correctly or not..




in this below example --> if you run the command -- ansible-playbook playbookname.yml --check
then this will check only the playbook is formatted correctly or not? it is not actually executing this playbook on managed node, but through above command you will get that pre validation check of the playbook..
