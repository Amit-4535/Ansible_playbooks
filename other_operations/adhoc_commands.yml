Ad-hoc commands are used to perform a single task quickly across one or more hosts.

They're ideal for:
•	Testing connectivity
•	Installing packages
•	Starting/stopping services
•	Copying files
•	Managing users, etc.


below are the examples..

ansible demo -b -m copy -a "src=/home/ubuntu/Ansible_playbooks/other_operations/adhoc_commands.yml dest=/home/ubuntu/adhoc_commands.yml"

ansible demo -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present"
ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=apache2 state=started"

ansible demo -m ping

ansible demo -b -m reboot

ansible demo -b -m file -a "name=/home/ubuntu/demo.txt state=touch"

ansible demo -b -m file -a "name=demo.txt state=touch"

ansible demo -b -m file -a "name=AMITDIRECTORY state=directory"

ansible demo -b -m user -a "name=Namrata state=present"
